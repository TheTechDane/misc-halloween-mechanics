# Small Halloween projects and tests
This is for a collection of smaller light and animatronics projects for halloween, I might split more in the future, now it is just to collect my early tests and projects in one place.

They are mainly based on ESP32-C3 Supermini as it is the cheapest ESP32 I could fine here is a good reference:https://www.espboards.dev/esp32/esp32-c3-super-mini/
You can buy the many places I got them on Aliexpress.
